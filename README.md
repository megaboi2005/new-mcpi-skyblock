# new-mcpi-skyblock
Rewrite of my original skyblock that aims to fix bugs and make gameplay smoother

## features
- seed support
- colliding islands now merge properly 
- trees (2 variants as of now)
- 3 biomes!!!
- ores
- and much more coming soon

## plans
- All the original biomes
- all the plants
- structures ðŸ‘€
- a way to "beat" the game
- can be imported as a library to be used to generate ores and trees as well as islands (not finished)
